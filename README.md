README# MIPS Simulator in Python

This is a MIPS simulator built in Python. The simulator executes instructions at the bit level and displays the value of the registers and data memory after each instruction. 

### Prerequisites

Project built using Python 3.6.5. Has not been tested on other Python version

## Running the program

See "test" file for an example set of instructions. Use this as a template for your instructions. Be careful, there is limited input validation.
